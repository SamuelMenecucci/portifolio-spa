# Portifolio SPA

Application developed for a college evaluative activity. The challenge was to develop a SPA (Single Page Application) without any library or framework, using only Javascript to manipulate the DOM, with only one HTML file in the entire application that is manipulated with javascript to change the page content. Another requirement was that it should have 3 pages, so I put 3 different sections: One about me, another that lists my github repositories and another with my contacts.
